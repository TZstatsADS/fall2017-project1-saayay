### [Project Description](doc/)
This is the first and only *individual* (as opposed to *team*) this semester. 

Term: Fall 2017

+ Projec title: Differences in inauguation speeches between single-term and multi-term presidents.
+ This project is conducted by Saaya Yasuda

+ Project summary: In this project, I looked at the presidents' inauguation speeches for those who belong to either Democratic or Republican parties. I compared the presidents who only served one-term to those who served multiple terms, and tried to find if there are any differences.
